<P>Sizes</P>
<P><reg>Length</reg>: 20-30cm</P>
<P><reg>Weight</reg>: Average 700g.</P>
<P><gap desc="figure"></P>
<P>Breeding</P>
<P>Sexual maturity: 11 months</P>
<P>Mating: April-August.</P>
<P>Gestation: About 32 days.</P>
<P>NO. Of young: up to 7 but usually 4 or 5.</P>
<P><gap desc="figure"></P>
<P>Related Species</P>
<P>There are 12 species of hedgehog found in Europe, Asia and Africa.  They differ only slightly in appearance and <reg>habits</reg>.</P>
<P><gap desc="figure"></P>
<P>Life style.</P>
<P><reg>Habit</reg>:  night-active and solitary.</P>
<P>Diet:  <reg>Caterpillars</reg>, beetles, earthworms, slugs, young mice and fruit.</P>
<P>Call:  snuffling noises while foraging.  These are louder when the <reg>hedgehog is</reg> mating and when it is disturbed</P>
<P>Life Span:  can live up to 6 years</P>
<P><pb desc="6">
</P>
<P><chpb desc="3"></P>
<P>DID YOU KNOW </P>
<P>There may be up to 500 fleas on one hedgehog but the specific hedgehog flea (Archaeopsylla erinacei) rarely bites humans.</P>
<P>When stimulated by a strong smell or taste, the hedgehog may &quot;self-anoint&quot;, or cover its prickles in foamy saliva.  No one is certain why it <reg>does</reg> this.</P>
<P><sic>Hedgehog</sic> are thought to <reg>carry</reg> apples that fall on <reg>their</reg> spines but hedgehogs don’t often eat fruit NOW.</P>
<P>People used to <reg>believe</reg> stories that told how hedgehogs could suck milk from cows.  Hedgehogs like milk and perhaps people <reg>believed</reg> these stories because they often saw hedgehogs <reg>near</reg> cow sheds.</P>
<P><pb desc="7">

<P><chpb desc="4"></P>
<P>DID YOU KNOW?</P>
<P>Did you know that hedgehogs don’t like company <reg>much</reg> </P>
<P>Did you know that hedgehogs have been around for 15 million years. </P>
<P>Did you know that <reg>hedgehogs</reg> <note desc="word/s or punctuation missing?"> small bright eyes but can’t see very well </P>
<P>Did you know that Female <sic>hedgehog</sic> have 2 litters every Year. </P>
<P>Did you know that <reg>hedgehogs</reg> can swim across small Ponds </P>

<P>BREEDING.</P>
<P>Loud snuffling noises in the dead of night from April to August may well be the sound of hedgehogs mating.  The male circles the female sometimes for hours, to persuade her to mate.  Then, afterwards, the two hedgehogs separate and the male takes no part in rearing the family.  The hedgehog young are born after about 32 days in a special &quot;maternity&quot; <reg>nest</reg>.  Late litters born in September, seldom survive their first winter</P>
<P>Blind until they are two weeks old, the young are able to hunt entirely for themselves.  After about four weeks <sic>she</sic> takes them on their first foraging trip out of the nest and some ten days later, the family separates.</P>

<P>HEDGEHOG FAMILES.</P>
<P>When baby <sic>hedgehog</sic> are first born <reg>their</reg> spines are rubbery not sharp, and  <sic>the</sic> are also covered in <reg>white</reg> <reg>skin</reg> this is to protect the mother at <reg>birth.<reg>.</P>
<P>A new born hedgehog is blind and helpless.  A few <reg>hours</reg> after birth, white spines start to poke out <reg>though</reg> its skin.  As the hedgehog grows the dark spines start to appear.</P>
<P>When a baby hedgehog is <reg>about</reg> 3 weeks old, the mother takes <sic>them</sic> on a short trip away from the nest.  They learn how to hunt for food by watching <reg>their</reg> mother.</P>
<P>When the baby <sic>hedgehog are</sic> between four and six weeks old, the mother raises <reg>her</reg> spines so that the <sic>hedgehog</sic> cannot feed from her milk. Then the hedgehogs Leave their mother and begin to live on <reg>their</reg> own.</P>

<P>A night on the prowl</P>
<P>Hedgehogs <note desc="word/s missing?"> a trotting walk and are most active between the hours of sunset and late evening.  Hedgehogs are more active than we think and they can <reg>travel</reg> a great distance in 7 <reg>hours</reg> or so.</P>

<P>food</P>
<P><reg>Hedgehogs’</reg> diet is made up from all sorts of insects, molluscs such as slugs, snails, frogs, small rodents and an occasional snake.  The hedgehog is mainly carnivorous and will not worry <reg>about</reg> tackling a snake.  The snake will find it hard to defend <reg>itself</reg> because of the <sic>hedge hog</sic> spines.  Even if the <sic>hedge hog</sic> gets bitten it <reg>doesn’t</reg> matter as it’s <reg>immune</reg> to the <reg>snake’s</reg> venom.  The hedgehog hunts after dark it <reg>searches</reg> for invertebrates and as there are more <reg>about</reg> at night this <sic>propely</sic> explains why the hedgehog is nocturnal.</P>
<P>Earthworms, millipedes and earwigs are also a <reg>favourite</reg> food of the hedgehog.  The hedgehog is called the  <reg>gardener’s</reg> friend because it eats so many pests in its diet.  Hedgehogs often raid mouse <sic>nest</sic> and feed on baby mice.  They eat small dead animals and soft <reg>fruit</reg> in Autumn.  Hedgehogs also eat cat and dog food put out by the owners in towns and villages.  people tend to put milk and bread out in their gardens to feed hedgehogs if they notice them.  This food and milk <sic>produces</sic> hedgehogs with a source of liquid in dry weather.</P>
<P>This extra food is essential in Autumn to help underweight babies put a layer of fat on to survive the winters.  It is dangerous to feed the hedgehogs on this all the time as it gives them <reg>diahorrea</reg> as the cows milk cannot be digested and upsets the intestines.  This is especially dangerous for baby hedgehogs.  In the summer hedgehogs eat lots of food ready for the winter.  Many hedgehogs die in winter because they can’t find <reg>enough</reg> food</P>

<P>Staying alive.</P>
<P>A hedgehog uses its spines to protect <reg>itself</reg> from other animals.  It protects <reg>itself</reg> by rolling its self in to a <reg>tight</reg> ball.  The <reg>crisscrossed</reg> <reg>pattern</reg> of prickles <reg>stops</reg> other animals from trying to eat <sic>her</sic>.</P>
<P>The hedgehog <reg>stays</reg> still until the other  <reg>animal’s</reg> nose is  <reg>over</reg> her then jumps up and <reg>stabs</reg> them in the nose.  Curling up <reg>does</reg> not protect hedgehogs from cars or lawn mowers.</P>

<P><chpb desc="10"></P>
<P>Hedgehog and MAN.</P>
<P>Gamekeepers used to kill all the hedgehogs they found, because the animals were known to eat birds eggs.  Today, hedgehogs die in their thousands on the road.</P>
<P>Sometimes the hedgehog’s choice of nesting place can lead to early death.  Some settle down to hibernate in bonfire stacks, and so perish during celebrations on guy Fawkes night.</P>

<P><chpb desc="13"></P>
<P><chpb desc="11"></P>
<P>HIBERNATION</P>
<P>Hedgehogs eat as much as they can during Summer and <reg>autumn</reg>.  There is not <reg>much</reg> food for animals during the winter.  In cold weather, <sic>the</sic> need food to keep their bodies warm.  So during the winter hedgehog hibernate.  During that time they live on the fat that <sic>the</sic> stored during the summer time.</P>
<P>A hedgehog makes winter nest in preparation for hibernation The nest that the hedgehog makes to sleep in during the day is a lot thinner than the nest for Hibernation.</P>
<P>Hibernation is more than deep sleep.  When a hedgehog hibernates its    <reg>heart</reg> beat <reg>slows</reg> down and its temperature falls.  It breathes <reg>about</reg> once every few seconds and looks as if it is dead.  Baby <sic>hedgehog</sic> may wake up during winter because they have not got enough <reg>body</reg> fat to keep them fed and warm <reg>throughout</reg> the cold winter months.</P>
<P>If you see a hedgehog give it bread and milk. because this may save a Life.</P>

<P>Distribution of the European Hedgehog.</P>
<P>Widespread in Britain and the rest of Europe from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean.  The European Hedgehog was also introduced to New Zealand by early settlers from england.</P>
<P>World wide Distribution of Hedgehogs.</P>
<P>There are lots of different types of hedgehogs &lt;UNCLEAR&gt; Russia and eat China.  In Africa and Asia, where it is hot there are desert Hedgehogs.</P>

<P>SPINES</P>
<P><gap desc="figure"></P>
<P>Hedgehogs have nearly 7,000 spines covering <reg>their</reg> backs and heads.</P>
<P>Baby <reg>hedgehogs’</reg> spines are soft and rubbery when They are first born.</P>
<P>When a hedgehog is scared it rolls up in to a <reg>tight</reg> ball of spikes.</P>
<P><gap desc="figure"></P>
<P>The hedgehog spines are hollow and springy, with <reg>flexible</reg> neck.</P>
<P>The base is a <reg>smooth</reg> ball</P>
