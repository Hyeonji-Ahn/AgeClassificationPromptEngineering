9 years old: Out at recess, Lissa and I played on the swings. ―Hey! Look over there!‖ Lissa shouted. Formed as an ocean wave, the cats ran toward me. 

10 years old: There were many benches all shoved to the right. It was hard to see the color In the murky dark but it seemed to be some sort of faded brown. The room was big, no, huge which gave it all the more reason to be terror bringing. Who knew what would be lurking in the corner!

11 years old: When Gus was a baby, he had to be kept in a cage because he wasn‘t allowed to interact with the other pets until he was older. He couldn‘t interact with the other pets because when Twister was a baby, the ferrets bit her ear and dragged her under the bed, and bit her in the back of the neck and we didn‘t want the same thing to happen to Gus.

17 years old: My mother passed away today...I just wanted to come here and ask for anyone willing to talk to me. My mom passed away this morning. Wrote us a note to all of us... well thatâ€™s the most I can bare to describe.
