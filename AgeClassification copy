    9 years old: Out at recess, Lissa and I played on the swings. ―Hey! Look over there!‖ Lissa shouted. Formed as an ocean wave, the cats ran toward me. 

    10 years old:I had had shots before. They were not your best friend. After a long while a nurse said, “Alyssa, Trevor, and Taryn, your turn.” It was our turn. I got half dragged and I half walked. The door creaked open. It was the room of no return. The door slammed shut. There was no way out. Gorwn-ups guarding every outry way, making sure we couldn’t escape. Seeing there was no way out we gave up and went for it.

    11 years old: Did you know that every cigarette a person smokes takes seven minutes off their life? I mentioned this because I just watched the movie, Benchwarmers, and I noticed that Carlos smoked. Why did you feel the need to have one of the characters smoke? Did you think that would make him look cool? Did you think that would make him look older? It did neither of those things. As a matter of fact, I think it made him look stupid and not very cool. Especially when he put out a cigarette on his tongue. 

    12 years old: If we already have cameras in the halls, why spend the money to get thirty more cameras for all the different classrooms? Our school district already has a low budget, so we would be spending money on something completely unnecessary. There hasn‘t been camera-worthy trouble in classrooms. Camera-worthy trouble would be bad behavior every time a teacher left the room. There is no reason to install cameras that might just cause trouble, both for the students and for the budget.

    14 years old: I want to ask. I'm an extrovert, but the more I come here, the more scared I am when I meet a lot of people, I feel anxious right away. Does anyone know why that is?

    15 years old: Unsettled !! That's when there is a test. But face it and get over it. It's been like that since the school days, the present can't be done like that. It could be

    16 years old: I want the pain to stopMy fiancee keeps hurting me. The nightmares from Afghanistan won't stop. I am hurting all the time. I feel so alone. I want to end it.

    17 years old: My mother passed away today...I just wanted to come here and ask for anyone willing to talk to me. My mom passed away this morning. Wrote us a note to all of us... well thatâ€™s the most I can bare to describe.
